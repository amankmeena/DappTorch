# DappTorch

## Project Description

DappTorch is a decentralized knowledge sharing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that empowers content creators and learners through a transparent reward mechanism. The platform enables users to create, share, and monetize educational content while building their reputation in the community. Users can upvote valuable content and directly reward creators with cryptocurrency, creating a sustainable ecosystem for knowledge sharing.

The smart contract implements a reputation system where users earn points for creating content and receiving upvotes. All content is stored on-chain with references to IPFS hashes, ensuring immutability and decentralization. The platform facilitates direct peer-to-peer transactions between content consumers and creators, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a truly decentralized and democratized knowledge economy where:

- **Content creators are fairly rewarded** for their educational contributions without platform fees
- **Quality content rises to the top** through community-driven upvoting mechanisms
- **Knowledge becomes accessible** to everyone regardless of geographic or economic barriers
- **Reputation is transparent and portable** across the decentralized ecosystem
- **Censorship-resistant learning** is possible through blockchain technology

We envision DappTorch as the foundation for a new era of education where learners and educators connect directly, value is distributed fairly, and knowledge truly becomes a public good powered by Web3 technology.
